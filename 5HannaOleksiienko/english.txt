Norway means narrow way through the straits, rather apt,given the mighty glacial fjords that lacerate its western coast.
Admittedly there is not much that’s spellbinding as I roll north out of Bergen.
The majesty comes later; for now I am passing the engineering workshops and other small factories serving the oil and gas industry that has made the city rich – again.

The charming buildings that surround the harbour are a reminder that Bergen was a successful business centre for many centuries, going back to its days as a Hanseatic port.

I am riding out in the wonderful, slightly watery, sunshine typical of Norway.
As I follow the fjord first east and then north before turning inland again to Voss, the rugged, often vertical countryside begins to work on me, raising thoughts of Vikings and moody gods.

Norways roads, bridges and tunnels are sparkling examples of their builders skill and tenacity, but they shrink to scratches on the mile-high cliffs if you look up a little. Whoops!
Not enough attention on the road and a long frost break is trying to turn my front wheel into oncoming traffic. Norways main roads are excellent, but not all back roads survive the brutal winters unscathed.
